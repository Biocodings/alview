I. Introduction.
Alview is a fast computer program for viewing BAM files.  Various
versions are available at my webserver at http://45.56.125.191/ .
Alview sourc is available via the NCI/NIH github at 
https://github.com/NCIP/alview .

This is relatively new, I'd appreciate feedback. Contact me at my email 
address : [finneyr AT mail nih gov](add @ and dots) with any questions 
or to troubleshoot a problem.  

Alview can take three forms:

#1 as a native standalone desktop GUI application. (Cocoa, GTK or WIN32).
#2 as a command line utility. 
#3 as a CGI web server.

It is supported on three Operating Systems:

#1 Windows 32 bit (works on 64bit)
#2 Linux (current binary release is 64 bit, recompilation on another UNIX is easy) 
#3 Apple MAC 64 bit

Alview is available via the NCI/NIH github at https://github.com/NCIP/alview
Please note the Windows GUI version installer.  The Alview Mac is available as
a DMG or as a tarball .  A 64bit Linux version is as is a tarball, too.

The command line can be used to batch create images of snp locations 
in bam files.  The user can then create a slide show for rapid viewing.  This 
takes some user engagement.  Alview currently supports hg18 and hg19 via large genome 
support files.  They are required.  More builds are forthcoming (mouse, GrCh38, 
etc).


II.  Power User Fast Start
Consult the Alview github page for the link to my webserver.  
Currently it is at http://45.56.125.191/ .  Various Alview builds are available there.

If you are blocked from installing your system, then do this: Pick or create a 
directory on your computer to put Alview in.   Download the binary for your system at 
https://github.com/NCIP/alview/tree/master/BINARIES.  Put it in your
directory.  Set permissions to the alview executable to "execute".
Download http://45.56.125.191/AlviewGenomeData.tar (from my 
webserver) to your Alview directory.  This is a hassle on slower connections; 
it might make take a few minutes on your home internet connection.  Untar this with 
"tar xvf AlviewGenomeData.tar" command (or use a graphical uncompression 
program for your OS).  Untar-ing (extracting) the genomic support data 
from "AlviewGenomeData.tar" creates genome subdirectories off of the
newly create directory named "GENOMEDATA" .  Make sure all new files have "read" 
permissions set correctly.  You may need to use chmod on Linux, Mac or
Cygwin or icacls.exe on Windows.  Cywgin users will want to check their work carefully.

Set up text configuration file "alview.conf".  This must be correct. The 
file "alview.conf" is editable using a text editor.  Check it carefully.
Make sure it points to the GENOMEDATA directory .  See the Section on "alview.conf"
file in this document for details.

For command line or webserver, you might have to compile it yourself; 
I provide several version at http://45.56.125.191/ .
It's pretty straightforward for Linux and Apple MAC ...  

Make and/or install  1) samtools and 2)zlib if they are not already there.  

Sample Compile for command line Using NEW samtools 1.0 ( after august 2014)  on Linux

# set samtools to proper directory for you system.
    gcc -Wall -DSAMTOOLS1=1 -DUNIX=1 -DCMD_LINE=1 -o alview alviewcore.cpp  -I. \
    -I/h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0/ \
    -I/h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0/htslib-1.0/ \
    -I/h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0/htslib-1.0/htslib/ \
    -L/h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0/ \
    /h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0/libbam.a \
    /h1/finneyr/samtools-1.0//htslib-1.0/libhts.a \
    -lbam -lm -lz -lgd -lpthread -lstdc++

Compile for command line Using old samtools  - compile for command line on Linux ...

#set samtools to proper directory for you system.
#****** note, can't mix c and cpp effortlessly  ** ouch ***
    cp alvmisc.c alvmisc.cpp
    gcc -Wall -DUNIX=1 -DCMD_LINE=1 -o alview_cmdline_linux alvmisc.cpp \
    alviewcore.cpp -I. -I/data/nextgen/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/ \
    -L/data/nextgen/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/  -lbam -lm -lz  -lstdc++


Cygwin users may need to modify the samtools make file to get samtools to 
compile.  For most, download samtools and "make" should do the trick.

Currently the samtools 1.1 is a bit hard to get right on Windows.  For Windows 
the samtools version 0.1.18 is what is currently supported and works with old 
compilers.  For a GUI Linux, users should install gtk2 (not gtk3) development 
packages.  This is easily install-able via apt-get or yum or your GUI installer.  
Know in what directories the libraries are in as you'll need to provide them 
to the linker.  

Sources for *Windows versions* of the required support libraries are provided at
Alview github (zlib and samtools).  Note that these are modified to work with 
the often very picky (Visual Studio) cl.exe C/C++ compiler.

Set the appropriate IFDEF flags.  These flags are APPLE, UNIX, WINDOWS,
WEB_SERVER, CMD_LINE  Set UNIX=1 for Linux. Set them as compiler flags.
Compile alview.cpp with proper flags and pointing to the proper libraries.   
Note that most version have static compilation, you can compile Alview with
shared libraries if you wish.

Windows users may just want to use the Linux version by using Cygwin; 
just compile Linux version and under CYGWIN.   You'll might need to install
zlib and samtools.  The makefile must be modified to make samtools 
support library compile.  Consult the internet for troubleshooting tips on making
samtools on Cygwin.

You will have to set up the genome data directory GENOMEDATADIR for the
command line version in the text file "alview.conf" properly !!!  Be careful.

Sample Webserver compilation for Linux ...

# note that you have to point to samtools directory, samtools 0.1.18
# version is safest version to use. 
    g++ -DUNIX -DWEB_SERVER=1 -UQT_GUI -UCOMMAND_LINE -DNATIVE -Wall -o alview \
    alviewcore.cpp alvmisc.cpp -lz -Wall -I/h1/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/ \
    /h1/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/libbam.a -lm -lz

See the WEBSERVER section for Web Server setup.


III. Installation
Alview is a fast computer program for viewing BAM files.  Various
versions are available at http://45.56.125.191/ .

Windows: run the Windows version installer from http://45.56.125.191/ .

APPLE MAC GUI: Download DMG file, click on it.  A Mac tarball is also available.
Alternately, you can hand install on MAC: 
    Download the "alvmac" binary executable file.
    Download GENOMEDATADIR data
    Edit alview.conf
    Check permission, run "alvmac".

Linux: A 64bit Linux version made on an old system is available, so it ~should~ run on
later 64 bit Linux versions. Download, untar , set permissions, edit 
"alview.conf", run alvgtk.  Hand install is this ...
    Download the "alvgtk" binary executable file.
    Download GENOMEDATADIR data
    Edit alview.conf
    Check permission, run "alvgtk".


IV. Compilation.
At the Alview github page, check README.md file for the latest versions with 
and additional instructions.  Remember, you can just install GUIs on your desktop, 
and some command line Alviews, but must compile for webserver or some command lines versions.
 
Install 1 samtools, 2) curses and 3)zlib if they are 
not already there.   Samtools is a non-standard package and must
be installed by hand.   The package "curses" and "zlib" are required by samtools. 
Sometimes curses is called "ncurses".

Linux compilation is done via the "gogtk" batch file.  
Edit this file ("gogtk") to point to your samtools.  
You may have to download gtk2 development library; which is not  big deal
if you have root or admin privileges.  Ask your sysadmin for help
or download and make gtk2 in your user local filesystems.

Set the appropriate IFDEF flags.  These flags are 
APPLE, UNIX, WINDOWS, WEB_SERVER, CMD_LINE.  You can set them via 
the command line program options as you invoke the compiler.

Example compilation on Linux for command line ...

    # note the -I and -L parameters need to point to *your*' samtools directory
    gcc -Wall -DUNIX=1 -DCMD_LINE=1 -o alview alviewcore.cpp  -I. \
    -I/data/nextgen/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/ \
    -L/data/nextgen/finneyr/samtools-0.1.18/ -lbam -lm -lz -lgd  -lstdc++ 

You must also download the large genome data support files targzipped in the
file http://45.56.125.191/AlviewGenomeData.tar . 
From the directory where you want to put a new GENOMEDATA directory,
run this command line to prepare this AlviewGenomeData.tar 

    tar xvf AlviewGenomeData.tar

(this works on on LINUX, Mac command line or Cygwin [ or cmd.exe with unix utilities ] )

Set up the "alview.conf" file .  Edit this file with a text editor.


V.  Operation as Command Line Utility.

You might have to compile for standalone or download a working version. See compilation section
if you need to compile. 

Running alview command line ...
    The command line argument are ...
        arg1 fn_bam = name of bam files (will use to determine bai file)
        arg2 outimg = output file name ( png file)
        arg3 position = example chr17:10000-10500  it can handle 17:10000-10500
                    type positions
        arg4 blds = build string (example "hg19")
        (optional) arg5 ih = image height
        (optional) arg6 iw = image width

So, create a batch file to call Alview repeatedly call to make pictures of
different BAM files or regions (centered on the SNP of interest).

*** THIS PART TAKES SOME USER INVOLVEMENT **
Feel free to improvise ot customize as you see fit.
Alview command line just takes a picture.  You can add lots of value
to this collection of pictures via other tools.  You can
use whatever tools you want to organize or examine these images.

You can view the output in a slideshow, the file "slideshowtemplate.html" is a
template file we provide for assisting in this.

Edit slideshowtemplate.html like this:
Set the "IMGSHERE" and "ANOSHERE" lines with image files and annotation.  This
is a little work, but makes viewing your massive 40,000 SNP calls easy to review!
This is probably the true power user's tool for reviewing his lab results and
prioritizing further work.

Actually reviewing your snp calls for anomalies can save you a lot of grief.


V.   Operation as Web Server

For the webserver, create the alview program for webserver and copy the 
resulting alview to the cgi-bin directory and check permissions.
See compilation for examples.

Then, set up the genome data directory and edit "alview.conf" properly.

Setting up the genome data directory involves this ... 
Download the *large* genome data support files which are in the tar file t
http://45.56.125.191/AlviewGenomeData.tar .  (This is my linode server).
 
This is large (1.6 GB) file and takes a while to decompress (via "tar xvf " command) 

Use this command

     tar xvf AlviewGenomeData.tar 

Edit "alview.conf" file to point to the correct genome data location that you
just created, make sure cgi programs can access this.
If in doubt, just set it up off the executable (cgi-bin) directory as a
subdirectory [ the default location should get detected].

Alview webserver uses 1 CSS and 3 javascript files. Hand install them from 
https://github.com/NCIP/alview/blob/master/MISC/ ...
Create at "js" directory off of your HTDOCS directory (the Apache default directory).
Make sure it's readable.

    alview.jquery-1.8.3.js                      - put in "js" of off the HTDOCS (default) directory
    alview.jquery-ui-1.9.2.custom.js            - put in "js" of off the HTDOCS (default) directory
    alview.jquery.imgareaselect.js              - put in "js" of off the HTDOCS (default) directory
    imgareaselect-default.css                   - put in HTDOCS (default) directory

Compile the file alviewcore.cpp with appropriate OS flag and define 
WEBSERVER to 1.  Install binary in cgi-bin directory and run as web
application.

Example webserver compilation:
 
    g++ -DUNIX -DWEB_SERVER=1 -UQT_GUI -UCOMMAND_LINE -DNATIVE -Wall -o alview  \
    alviewcore.cpp alvmisc.cpp -lz -Wall -I${SAMTOOLSDIR} ${SAMTOOLSDIR}/libbam.a -lm -lz 

Edit the text file list of files called "list.public" to list the full paths 
to your bam files.  Place this in the cgi-bin directory.

Example "list.public" file is ...

#This is list for PUBLIC ALVIEW - public datasets - comments begin with #
/tcga_next_gen_a/bam_tier_2/GASTRIC/AGP1_RNA.bam AGP1_RNA T Asian_Gastric_RNA
/tcga_next_gen_a/bam_tier_2/GASTRIC/AGP2_RNA.bam AGP2_RNA T Asian_Gastric_RNA
/tcga_next_gen_a/bam_tier_2/GASTRIC/AGP3_RNA.bam AGP3_RNA T Asian_Gastric_RNA
/tcga_next_gen_a/bam_tier_2/GASTRIC/AGP4_RNA.bam AGP4_RNA T Asian_Gastric_RNA

Hooks in the code are available for creating your own security mechanisms.
****This is the user's responsibility****
For instance you can create user logins and examine cookies and you on user databases.
Additionally, you could restrict access  to certain IP addresses.


VI.  Running Alview as a GUI 
Enter the genomic coordinates in the position box or a HUGO gene name.
You can drag select with a mouse a region to zoom in.
You can use the navigation buttons to move around.
You can use the quality flag to view a grayscale graphic of the quality
values (if available).

VII. alview.conf file

Example "alview.conf" file , this one is setup for windows...
This must be a text file, not a word file or html file.
