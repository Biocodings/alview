Installation Quick Start.

1) Decide where to put your alview executable and support data, support data is about 1 GB per build (example hg18, hg19 )
   The default location for the  GENOMEDATADIR specified in alview.conf file is in a directory called GENOMEDATADIR off the  
   alview executeable's directory. Easiest way is to pick a directory for alview, and create GENOMEDATADIR there.

2) Download the executable for your system

alvgtk               LINUX
alview.exe           WINDOWS
alvmace              MAC

3) Download the build(s) you want and put therm where you decided to put them in #1

4) edit alview.conf

An example  ... notice that the windows line is uncommented.  This is an example 
# comments stat with #
# USE / at end of directories

GENOMEDATADIR=c:\rich\GENOMEDATA\
# helix linux
#GENOMEDATADIR=/scratch/ALVIEW/GENOMEDATA/
# linux  ...
#GENOMEDATADIR=/home/rfinney/GENOMEDATA/
